Yes, I know, proprietary, riddled with security flaws, required a plugin etc. etc. Despite this, many years after "the death of flash", animation on the web still hasn't come anywhere close to what flash could achieve. Instead, faster broadband has provided us with hi-res video - and most remarkable of all, a massive rebirth of animated GIFs, some of which clock in at ridiculous file sizes. We take this fore-granted, as our net connections are that much faster. I did expect web animation post flash to move at a far quicker pace than is has, however, it seems the barrier to entry and the lack of decent GUI tools is still hobbling progress.`,
